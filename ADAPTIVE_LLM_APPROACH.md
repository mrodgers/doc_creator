# Adaptive LLM Approach with Self-Evaluation and Prompt Evolution

## Overview

The Adaptive LLM Matcher implements a sophisticated step-by-step approach that uses LLM self-evaluation and prompt evolution to continuously improve matching performance. This approach addresses the limitations of static prompts by creating a feedback loop that evolves prompts based on performance analysis.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. **Initial LLM Matching**
- **Purpose**: Perform initial semantic section matching using the current prompt version
- **Process**: 
  - Parse document sections and template sections
  - Create matching prompt with current version
  - Execute LLM matching with structured output
- **Output**: Initial matches with confidence scores and reasoning

### 2. **LLM Self-Evaluation**
- **Purpose**: Have the LLM evaluate its own matching performance
- **Process**:
  - Analyze matching results against evaluation criteria
  - Identify coverage, confidence, reasoning, and semantic accuracy issues
  - Generate performance score (0-100)
  - Identify specific areas for improvement
- **Output**: Comprehensive evaluation with issues and suggestions

### 3. **Prompt Improvement Suggestions**
- **Purpose**: Generate specific suggestions for prompt improvement
- **Process**:
  - Analyze evaluation results
  - Identify prompt weaknesses
  - Generate prioritized improvement suggestions
  - Determine if evolution is needed
- **Output**: Prioritized suggestions with expected impact

### 4. **Prompt Evolution**
- **Purpose**: Evolve the prompt based on suggestions
- **Process**:
  - Incorporate improvement suggestions into prompt
  - Maintain core structure while enhancing effectiveness
  - Version control for prompt changes
  - Track evolution history
- **Output**: Improved prompt with version tracking

### 5. **Re-running with Evolved Prompt**
- **Purpose**: Test the evolved prompt's effectiveness
- **Process**:
  - Re-run matching with evolved prompt
  - Compare performance with initial results
  - Validate improvements
- **Output**: Final results with evolution impact

## Key Components

### AdaptiveLLMMatcher Class
```python
class AdaptiveLLMMatcher:
    def analyze_document_adaptive(self, document_path: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Step 1: Parse document
        # Step 2: Initial LLM matching
        # Step 3: Self-evaluation
        # Step 4: Prompt improvement suggestions
        # Step 5: Evolve prompt if needed
        # Step 6: Re-run with evolved prompt
        # Step 7: Compile results
```

### Data Structures
- **MatchResult**: Structured match with confidence and reasoning
- **EvaluationResult**: Self-evaluation with issues and suggestions
- **PromptEvolution**: Tracks prompt changes and performance metrics

### Evolution Tracking
- **Version Control**: Automatic version incrementing (1.0 → 1.1 → 1.2...)
- **History**: Complete prompt evolution history with timestamps
- **Performance Metrics**: Track effectiveness across evolution cycles

## Benefits of This Approach

### 1. **Continuous Improvement**

## Performance Metrics

### Effectiveness Scoring
```python
effectiveness_score = (
    coverage_factor * 0.3 +
    match_quality_factor * 0.25 +
    overall_score_factor * 0.25 +
    evolution_success_factor * 0.2
)
```

### Evolution Success Rate
- Percentage of cycles where evolution occurred
- Quality of improvement suggestions
- Impact of evolved prompts

### Trend Analysis
- Performance improvement over time
- Coverage enhancement

## Implementation Details

### Prompt Structure
The evolved prompts include:
- **Analysis Criteria**: Clear definitions with examples
- **Matching Guidelines**: Specific rules and considerations
- **Scoring System**: Structured evaluation framework

- **Common Pitfalls**: Error prevention guidance
- **Response Format**: Structured output requirements

### Evolution Triggers
- Low overall performance score (< 60)
- High number of confidence issues
- Poor reasoning quality
- Low coverage percentage
- Specific improvement suggestions

### Quality Control
- Version tracking for all changes
- Performance comparison between versions
- Rollback capability to previous versions
- Validation of evolved prompts

## Usage Examples

### Single Evolution Cycle
```python
matcher = AdaptiveLLMMatcher("template.json")
results = matcher.analyze_document_adaptive("document.docx")
matcher.print_adaptive_results(results)
```

### Multiple Evolution Cycles
```python
test = AdaptiveEvolutionTest("template.json")
results = test.test_multiple_evolution_cycles(["doc1.docx", "doc2.pdf", "doc3.html"])
```

## Results and Analysis
