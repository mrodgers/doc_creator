[p] Chapter Title
[p] View with Adobe Reader on a variety of devices
[p] View in various apps on iPhone, iPad, Android, Sony Reader, or Windows Phone
[p] View on Kindle device or Kindle app on multiple devices
[p] For instructions on setting up the switch using the WebUI, refer to the required version of thesoftware configuration guide. In the guide, go toConfiguring the Switch Using the Web User Interface.
[p] 
[p] Configuring the Switch Using the CLI
[p] You can access the CLI on a
                           		configured or unconfigured switch by connecting the RJ-45 console port or USB
                           		console port of the switch to your PC or workstation and accessing the switch
                           		through a terminal emulation program.
[p] Note
[p] If you have stacked your switches, connect to the console port of one of the switches in the stack. You can initially configure
                                       the entire stack from any member switch.
[p] Step 1
[p] Connect the RJ45 port adapter to the serial port on the terminal server or your PC using the optional RJ45-to-DB9 adapter
                                          cable. Connect the other end of the cable to the switch console port.
[p] Step 2
[p] Start the terminal-emulation program on the PC or the terminal. The program,
                                          					frequently a PC application such as Putty or TeraTerm, makes communication
                                          					between the switch and your PC or terminal possible.
[p] Step 3
[p] Configure the baud rate and character format of the PC or terminal to match the
                                          					console port default characteristics:
[p] 9600 baud
[p] 8 data bits
[p] 1 stop bit
[p] No parity
[p] None (flow control)
[p] Step 4
[p] Power on the switch.
[p] Step 5
[p] The PC or terminal displays the bootloader sequence. PressEnterto display the setup prompt.
[p] The Cisco Catalyst9300Series Switches will either have the Cisco USB Device or Silicon Labs USB Device (CP2102N). To identify which USB device
                                 is in the switch, do the following:
[p] Connect a USB cable from the Windows-based PC or Mac-based PC to the USB console port.
[p] On the Windows-based PC, open the Device Manager or on the Mac-based PC, open the System Report and view the following:
[p] Type of USB Device
[p] Device Name
[p] Cisco USB device
[p] Cisco USB Console or USB Serial Device
[p] Silicon Labs USB device
[p] Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge  or CP2102N USB to UART Bridge
[p] Step 1
[p] To install the USB driver to a Windows-based PC or Mac-based PC for the first time, do the following:.
[p] Windows-based PC
[p] For Cisco USB Device, seeInstalling the Microsoft Windows USB Device Driver.
[p] For Silicon Labs USB Device. you can either download the USB driver from the Silicon Labswebsiteor seeInstalling the Silicon Labs Windows USB Device Driver.
[p] Mac-based PC
[p] For Cisco USB Device, no driver installation is required.
[p] For Silicon Labs USB Device. you can download the USB driver from the Silicon Labswebsite. Once the installation is completed, a virtual COM port session, "tty.SLAB_USBtoUART", will be started.
[p] Note
[p] Do not use the generic USB serial driver available on the Mac-based PC.
[p] Note
[p] USB Type A port on the switch provides file system support and isNOTa console port. See USB Type A Port section.
[p] Step 2
[p] Connect a USB cable to the PC USB port. Connect the other end of the cable to the switchmini-B(5-pin-connector) USB console port.
[p] Step 3
[p] Start the terminal-emulation program on the PC or the terminal. The program,
                                          					frequently a PC application such as Putty or TeraTerm, makes communication
                                          					between the switch and your PC or terminal possible.
[p] Step 4
[p] Configure the
                                          			 baud rate and character format of the PC or terminal to match the console port
                                          			 default characteristics:
[p] 9600 baud
[p] 8 data bits
[p] 1 stop bit
[p] No parity
[p] None (flow control)
[p] Step 5
[p] Power on the
                                          			 switch as described in the switch getting started guide.
[p] Step 6
[p] The PC or
                                          			 terminal displays the bootloader sequence. PressEnterto display the
                                          			 setup prompt. Follow the steps in the Setup program.
[p] A USB device driver must be installed the first time a Microsoft Windows-based PC is connected to the USB console port on
                           the switch.
[p] Step 1
[p] Obtain the Cisco USB console driver file from the Cisco.com web site and unzip it.
[p] Note
[p] You can download the driver file from the Cisco.com site for downloading the switch software.
[p] Windows 10 includes a USB to RS232 driver. However for added functionality, download the USB Console Software from the Software
                                             Download Center at cisco.com.
[p] Step 2
[p] If using 32-bit Windows,
                                          double-click the setup.exe file in the Windows_32 folder. If using 64-bit
                                          Windows, double-click the setup(x64).exe file in the Windows_64 folder.
[p] Step 3
[p] The Cisco Virtual Com InstallShield Wizard begins. ClickNext.
[p] Step 4
[p] The Ready to Install the Program window appears. ClickInstall.
[p] Note
[p] If a User Account Control warning appears, clickAllow - I trust this programto proceed.
[p] Step 5
[p] The InstallShield Wizard Completed window appears. ClickFinish.
[p] Step 6
[p] Connect the USB cable to the PC and the switch console port. The USB console port LED turns green, and the Found New Hardware
                                          Wizard appears. Follow the instructions to complete the driver installation.
[p] Step 1
[p] Connect a USB cable to the PC USB port. Connect the other end of the cable to the switchmini-B(5-pin-connector) USB console port.
[p] Step 2
[p] Launch the Windows Update page by clicking on theUpdate & Securitybutton on the Windows Settings.
[p] Step 3
[p] ClickView optional updates.
[p] Step 4
[p] ExpandDriver updatesand selectSilicon Laboratories Inc. – Ports 10.x.x.x.
[p] Step 5
[p] ClickDownload and installbutton.
[p] Once the driver installation is complete, disconnect the USB cable from the PC USB port and the switch.
[p] Note
[p] Windows assigns different COM ports to Silicon Labs USB device. To view the COM port assignment, see Device Manager.
[p] Disconnect the switch console terminal before uninstalling the driver.
[p] Step 1
[p] Run setup.exe for Windows 32-bit or setup(x64).exe for Windows-64bit. ClickNext.
[p] Step 2
[p] The InstallShield Wizard for Cisco Virtual Com appears. ClickNext.
